    \brief Implementation of reusable barrier
  
    \param int numThreads - The number of threads that the barrier will work with
    \param Semaphore first{0} - The first semaphore initialized to 0, used as a turnstile in concurrence with the second one below.
    \param Semaphore second{1} - The second semaphore, initialized to 1 and used as a turnstile in concurrence with the first one.
    \param Semaphore mutexSem{1} - The semaphore inizialized to 1 and used as a mutex lock.It allows the first thread to pass through and no wait,
    but all the others will  wait until the thread in the critical section finish its work and signals the next one.
    \param int barrierCount = 0 - Counter variable used to keep track of the last thread through each phase
